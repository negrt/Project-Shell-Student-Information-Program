# Project_Shell_Student_Information_Program
In this porject, the user will be able to do the following regarding student information: add records, view records, delete records, search for records. This project was created in a Linux environment while remotely accessing the machine it was created on via the Putty software application on a Window 10 Desktop computer from home. I created this project when I was taking a course called UNIX operating systems at SUNY Farmingdale State College.
